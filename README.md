# BLOCKCHAIN-TECHNOLOGY-AND-APPLICATIONS
# Simple Blockchain in Python

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain using Python. It demonstrates fundamental blockchain principles such as:

- Block creation with unique cryptographic hash
- Linking blocks using previous hash
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm
- Blockchain integrity validation

## Features

- Genesis block creation
- SHA-256 hash generation
- Proof-of-Work with difficulty level
- Transaction data input
- Chain validation check
- Console output for block details

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python blockchain_with_pow.py
```

## Sample Output

```
